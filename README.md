## `TurboRDM-ED`

Minimal implementation of a fast-trace algorithm to compute reduced density matrices within quantum (cluster) impurity problems. Based on the [QcmPlab](https://github.com/QcmPlab) exact-diagonalization solvers, whose Fock-space structure is assumed. More specifically here we assume Sz-conservation, implemented in a generalized Lin-Gubernatis scheme. More info available [on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06806).

The algorithm is fully included on the master branch of [QcmPlab/CDMFT-LANC-ED](https://github.com/QcmPlab/CDMFT-LANC-ED) since commit [ed4ba2d](https://github.com/QcmPlab/CDMFT-LANC-ED/commit/ed4ba2d798d31588da7675565e2dd0c1ce821744).

#### Dependencies

The code relies on the [SciFortran](https://github.com/QcmPlab/SciFortran) library.  
The dependency list included therein applies (except MPI and Scalapack that here are totally irrelevant).

#### Code structure

- The `COMMON_VARS` module defines all the global types and methods, including the dynamical, sparse data structures needed to build a bath-impurity separated Fock-space map, suitable to boost bath-tracing speed.
- The `AUX_FUNX` module implements the Sz-sector building routine, i.e. the core of the present implementation, together with many auxiliary procedures (some of which imported verbatim from the QcmPlab ED libraries). A special mention goes to the subtracing procedures, that exploit a further bitwise factorizazion of the states, so to allow a site-by-site reduction of the impurity density matrix in the cluster case; the tracing therein does not implement the fast algorithm since the bit-dimension of the impurity states does not justify further loading of the data structures and the direct recipe has an acceptable performance.
- The `main` driver performs several tests on both the main fast-trace over the bath states and the site-by-site subtrace. It parses some input variables and flags so to build a suitable _fictitious_ eigenspace, by generating some random/uniform eigenvectors. Then it calls the map-building procedure and feeds everything to the slow- and fast-bath-tracing algorithms and to the subtracing routine. Finally it compares all the resulting matrices, together with the required cpu times.

#### Input file

The makefile compiles the program, putting the executable in the `test/` directory. There you can find an editable input-file, where you can define the dimension of the impurity problem and set some flags for the tests.

```
NLAT  : number of sites in the cluster; 1 corresponds to the standard Anderson Impurity Model (AIM).
NORB  : number of orbitals per site.
NBATH : number of bath levels per site, per orbital (*)
NUP   : the [Nup,Ndw] tuple defines the given sector by means of the Sz = Nup - Ndw identity;
NDW     do not forget the obvious constraint: Ns = Nup + Ndw = Nlat * Norb * (Nbath + 1).

VERBOSE : if T prints a lot (loads!) of useful information on screen.
FAST    : if T skips the slow algorithm for the bath trace.
RANDOM  : if T gives random eigenvectors; else all the sector will contribute with a uniform weight.

(*) Think of the bath as a set of noninteracting replicas of the cluster.
